# Gita Practice

Gita Practice is a focused application for strengthening Bhagavad Gita recitation through structured audio practice. It offers two practice modes with flexible pacing, letting you recite at your own rhythm while the program guides the flow.

## Overview

Choose a chapter, set your pace, and press **Play**. The app plays shlokas and gives you time to recite, either by waiting for your confirmation or by timing each turn automatically.

## Practice Modes

### Individual Practice

- The app plays a random shloka from the selected chapter.
- It becomes your turn to recite the next shloka.
- The cycle continues with more random shlokas and your recitation after each one.
