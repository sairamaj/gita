Use this section to practice reciting Bhagavad Gita verses individually. 

## How It Works

1. **Random Shloka**: The program plays a random shloka from the selected chapter
2. **Your Turn**: After the random shloka plays, it's your turn to recite the next shloka
3. **Practice Cycle**: The program continues playing random shlokas, and after each one, you recite the next shloka

## Features

- **Chapter Selection**: The currently selected chapter is displayed at the top
- **Wait Mode**: Choose how to wait between shlokas:
  - **Keyboard Hit**: The program waits for you to press OK to finish your turn and proceed
  - **Duration**: The program waits for a specified number of seconds before playing the next random shloka
- **Duration**: When using Duration wait mode, specify how many seconds to wait (this is your time to recite)
- **Repeat Your Sloka**: Check this box if you want to hear your sloka again after you recite it
- **Playback Speed**: Adjust the playback speed from 0.5x to 2.0x using the slider

## Controls

- **Play**: Start the individual practice session. The program will play a random shloka, then wait for you to recite the next one
- **Stop**: Stop the practice session at any time
